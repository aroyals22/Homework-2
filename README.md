Using Bootstrap to create portfolio
First, the major thing you'll notice is i didnt use external CSS file to style my page.  While i know in-line styling is not best practice i just wanted to make bootstrap the star of this HW assignment. 
I decided to utilize the jumbotron element for the header.  While it may have been a better option to use .navbar-brand, i wanted to play around with different bootstrap elements that i wasnt familiar with.

I was able to get my nav-bar turn into a hamburger button when on a small screen and also have the images and content be responsive when changing screen size. 
I was able to install a fixed footer, while my content is not enough to have a scroll bar, if you make the screen small you can see the footer stick regardless of scroll. 
Lastly, i was able to utilize containters, rows, and columns to achieve desired layout.
